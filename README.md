# üå¶ Weather Forecasting Using Machine Learning  

## üìå Overview  
Weather forecasting is crucial for diverse sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and disaster management. This project leverages machine learning to enhance the accuracy of weather predictions, particularly focusing on rainfall forecasting. Using the **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** algorithm, the project analyzes meteorological parameters like temperature, humidity, pressure, and wind speed to predict whether it will rain tomorrow based on historical data.
